title: Azure Key Vault Connector
description: Rotate secrets in Azure Key Vault (Placeholder)
---

⚠️ **Placeholder Implementation** - Requires Azure SDK for full functionality.

## Status

The Azure Key Vault connector is currently a placeholder that requires the official Azure SDK (`azure-security-keyvault`) for production use.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Key Vault
- Service principal with appropriate permissions

## Setup

```bash
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
export AZURE_VAULT_NAME="your-vault-name"
```

## Current Behavior

When you attempt to use the Azure connector, you'll see a placeholder message indicating the SDK is required.

## Implementation Required

To complete this connector, add Azure SDK dependencies and implement:
- Secret value updates
- Secret retrieval
- Service refresh triggers (App Service, Container Apps, etc.)
