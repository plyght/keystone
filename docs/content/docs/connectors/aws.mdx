title: AWS Secrets Manager Connector
description: Rotate secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (Placeholder)
---

⚠️ **Placeholder Implementation** - Requires AWS SDK for full functionality.

## Status

The AWS Secrets Manager connector is currently a placeholder that requires the official AWS SDK (`aws-sdk-secretsmanager`) for production use.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with Secrets Manager access
- AWS credentials with appropriate IAM permissions

## Setup

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

## Current Behavior

When you attempt to use the AWS connector, you'll see:

```
⚠️  AWS Secrets Manager integration requires AWS SDK
   Secret name: MY_SECRET
   Region: us-east-1
   This is a placeholder implementation
```

## Implementation Required

To complete this connector, add `aws-sdk-secretsmanager` dependency and implement:
- Secret value updates
- Secret retrieval
- Service refresh triggers (ECS, Lambda, etc.)

## Workaround

Until the full implementation is complete, you can:
1. Use AWS CLI directly for secret rotation
2. Implement a custom connector
3. Contribute to the project by adding AWS SDK integration
