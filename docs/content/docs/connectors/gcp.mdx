title: GCP Secret Manager Connector
description: Rotate secrets in GCP Secret Manager (Placeholder)
---

⚠️ **Placeholder Implementation** - Requires GCP SDK for full functionality.

## Status

The GCP Secret Manager connector is currently a placeholder that requires the official GCP SDK (`google-secretmanager`) for production use.

## Prerequisites

- GCP project with Secret Manager API enabled
- Service account with appropriate permissions

## Setup

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/credentials.json"
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

## Current Behavior

When you attempt to use the GCP connector, you'll see a placeholder message indicating the SDK is required.

## Implementation Required

To complete this connector, add GCP SDK dependencies and implement:
- Secret value updates
- Secret retrieval
- Service refresh triggers (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, etc.)
