Keystone is an open-source CLI tool for safe, fast secret rotation. It updates local `.env` files and production host secrets by name, without proxying traffic. Your applications call provider APIs directly with their own keys.

## Features

- **Dev Mode**: Update `.env` files atomically with rollback support
- **Production Mode**: Integrate with major hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Cloudflare, Fly.io) and cloud secret managers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **App-Signal Rotation**: Accept rotation requests from applications (e.g., on 429/rate-limit headers)
- **Manual & Scheduled**: Operator-triggered and cron-friendly
- **Rollback**: Time-boxed rollback with automatic key revocation
- **Audit Logging**: Cryptographically signed logs with Ed25519
- **Safety Rails**: Single-writer locks, cooldowns, dry-run mode, maintenance windows

## Architecture

Keystone is a single Rust binary with:
- CLI for manual operations
- Optional background daemon for app-signal handling
- File-based locking and audit logging
- Connector architecture for provider integrations

**No traffic proxying. No central secret storage.** Just direct updates to your `.env` files and provider APIs.
