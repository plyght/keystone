## Quick Reference

### Daily Operations

- Monitor daemon health: `keystone daemon status`
- Check recent rotations: `keystone audit --last 10`
- Review locks: `ls -la ~/.keystone/locks/`

### Emergency Response

For compromised secrets:

1. Rotate immediately: `keystone rotate SECRET --env prod --service SERVICE`
2. Revoke old key at provider
3. Check audit logs: `keystone audit SECRET --env prod`
4. Document incident

### Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:

- Daemon uptime and health
- Failed rotation attempts
- Lock contention
- Audit log integrity
- Provider API availability

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and resolutions:

- **Lock held**: Check if process is running, remove stale locks after 5min timeout
- **Cooldown active**: Wait for cooldown or adjust settings
- **Provider API error**: Check credentials and API status
- **Rollback window expired**: Manual key regeneration required

## Best Practices

1. **Always dry-run first** in production
2. **Test in staging** before production
3. **Monitor audit logs** for anomalies
4. **Rotate regularly** before expiration
5. **Keep credentials secure** and rotate them too
6. **Document all manual interventions**
7. **Set up alerts** for failed rotations
